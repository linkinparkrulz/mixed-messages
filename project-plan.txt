The project is to build a message generator. When a user runs the program, they receive a randomized output.

Do i want to doi something specific? Bitcoin related message generator?

The way i visualize the project:

	- There is 3 pieces of data
	- To randomize 3 pieces of data I think I would use arrays
	- Where am I getting the random data from?
	- Maybe I'll get more detail in the next step

CODING JOURNAL:

So, I have to come up with a topic. I think I am going to do a message generator based on sats. It will output 3 things:

	- Sats per CAD
	- How many Sats I should buy that day
	- Total amount in cuck bucks I need to purchase sats

I've completed the program. I found an api that I was able to process the request from. My troubles ended up being with how I orgranized
the code. Using functions, I was able to organize the code effectively.

Along the way, I learned a little more about the round function (it doesn't have a lot of function). Also, for the title "SATS CALC" I learned about
the raw method of String.
